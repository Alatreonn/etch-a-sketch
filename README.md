## Summary
A different take on the Etch-A-Sketch. In contrast to the original handheld toy, this digital recreation allows you to paint by hovering the cursor on the screen. Also, the rods were replaced with buttons for erasing and toggling between black and rainbow color. You can also resize the screen to your needs for more precision!

## General Usage Tips
1. Hover your cursor on any square to paint.
2. Toggle between Black and Rainbow (random color) by clicking the "RAINBOW" button. The button should be black, that means the "Rainbow Mode" is selected!
3. Erase the screen by clicking the "RESET" button!
4. You can also resize the screen by typing any number between 2 and 100 and then pressing the wide button directly under the input field. This will create a canvas between 2x2 and 100x100 squares!
5. If you want to go against the rules, you can "cheat" the system by right clicking anywhere once and hovering on a specific square you want to paint!
